# PDF Generator
PDF Generator build for Node, relying on [Puppeteers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) and [Mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache) to generate PDFs from HTML templates.

This package receives input data in `JSON` format, then generates and returns a PDF file Buffer.
